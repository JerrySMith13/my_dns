RFC 1035 - DNS

- Message is both question and answer
- QTYPE = TYPE = A, CNAME, etc.
- QCLASS = 3.2.4

# DNS message format:

headers: 
- ID - 16 bit id identifying messages for resolver
next byte: 
- QR - single bit specifying whether message is query or response
- opcode - 4 bit num specifying kind of query:
	- possible values: standard query, inverse, server status (see 4.1.1)
- authoritative answer - bit is only valid in responses, specifies that the server is an authority for the domain name in Q section
- TC bit - specifies that message was truncated due to a length more than permitted by channel
- RD - recursion desired bit

next byte:
- RA - recursion available bit
- Z - 3 bit reserved space, must all be 0
RCODE - 4 bit response code (1 = formaterr, 2 = serverr, 3 = namenotexist, 4 = notimpl, 5 = refused)

next byte(s):  
QDCOUNT - 16 bit int specifying num questions
ANCOUND - uint16 specifying num answers 
NSCOUNT - uint16 - num ns resource records
ARCOUNT - uint16 num entries in additional records 


question entry(s):
qname - domain name (label sequence)
	- labels are a string with a leading byte representing length
		[5 as byte, 'h', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o']
qtype - uint16 representing TYPE field from 3
qclass - uint16 representing CLASS field from 3

note: rr = resource record
rr entry(s):
NAME - domain name for record
TYPE - uint16 representing rr TYPE code from 3
CLASS - uint16 for class of RDATA
TTL - uint32 specifying TTL in seconds for caching
	If TTL is 0, then record SHOULD NOT be cached
RDLENGTH - uint16 - len(in octets) of RDATA string
RDATA - string of rdata given meaning by class + type

NAME compression tecniques:
if leading two bytes are 0, then it is normal name
if leading two bytes are 1, then it is pointer
- pointer's remaining 63 octets
